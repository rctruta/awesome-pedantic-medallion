# How to Contribute

We are thrilled that you're interested in contributing to the Awesome Pedantic Medallion playbook! Your examples are what will make this a rich and valuable resource for everyone.

### What We're Looking For

We are looking for clear, powerful examples of explanations that fit into one of the three Medallion layers:

*   **[BRONZE]:** A powerful, foundational analogy for a complex topic.
*   **[SILVER]:** A targeted, domain-specific explanation for practitioners.
*   **[GOLD]:** A canonical, authoritative definition or principle.

The goal is clarity and empathy. The best examples are ones you have used successfully to help others understand a difficult concept.

### How to Submit an Example

1.  **Fork this repository.**
2.  **Create a new Markdown file** inside the appropriate folder (`/examples/bronze/`, `/examples/silver/`, or `/examples/gold/`). Please use a descriptive filename, like `explaining-apis-with-pizza.md`.
3.  **Write your example** in the file. Please start by stating the concept and then providing the explanation.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request** to this repository with a brief description of your contribution.

We will review all submissions and work with you to get them merged. Thank you for helping us fight cognitive friction!
