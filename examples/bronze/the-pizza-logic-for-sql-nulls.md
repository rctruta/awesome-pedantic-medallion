### Summary

This playbook tackles one of the most confusing concepts in data: the three-valued logic of SQL's `NULL`. It uses a simple, powerful, and universally understood analogy—ordering a pizza with unknown topping preferences—to build a durable mental model for why a comparison with `NULL` results in `UNKNOWN`, not `FALSE`.

The article demonstrates how our natural binary (True/False) thinking leads to common bugs in SQL queries, and provides a Bronze-layer "pizza logic" to build a new intuition. This is a foundational explanation for anyone who works with data, from beginners to seasoned professionals who still get tripped up by `NULL`.
